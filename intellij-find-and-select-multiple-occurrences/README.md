## IntelliJ: Find & Select Multiple Occurrences
_Select multiple occurrences of the same word and change them all at once_

Place your caret on the word or text range you want to find and 
select multiple occurrences of and then use `⌃G` (macOS), 
`Alt+J` (Windows/Linux) to find and select the next occurrence of the word. 
This is a case-sensitive search. You can use `⌃⌘G` (macOS), or `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+J` 
to select all matching words in the document rather than selecting one at a 
time. You can use `⌃⇧G` (macOS), or `Alt+Shift+J` (Windows/Linux) to remove 
the selection from the last selected occurrence. To skip an occurrence, 
use `⌘G` (macOS), `F3` (Windows/Linux) and to go back to the last selected 
occurrence, use `⇧⌘G` (macOS), or `Shift+F3` (Windows/Linux).
